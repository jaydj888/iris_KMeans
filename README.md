# iris_KMeans
K Means clustering on the Iris dataset using Python.

I have demonstrated K Means classifier which is an an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset. 
First, each data point is randomly assigned to one of the K clusters. Then, we compute the centroid (functionally the center) of each cluster, and reassign each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid. We repeat this process until the cluster assignments for each data point are no longer changing.
